## Special Thanks
Special thanks to:

#### [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)

#### [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)

##### Fake User data from generatedata.com.
Note: users.json is a great way to show some example data. I highly recommend using an alternate solution in a live environment.
